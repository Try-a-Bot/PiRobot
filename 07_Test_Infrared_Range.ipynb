    "The Infrared Range Sensor enables your robot to detect objects. Unlike ultrasonic sensors, which use sound waves to measure distance, the IR Range Sensor uses infrared light. On one side of the sensor an infrared LED shines a beam of light, which is reflected back by the closest object, and detected by the receiver on the other side of the sensor. The sensor then uses a method called triangulation to determine how far away the object was.\n",
    "<p>The basis for triangulation is that objects at different distances will reflect the infrared beam back to the receiver at different angles. The varying angles produce different voltage levels in the sensor, and in turn sensor values that can be used to calculate distance. See below:</p>\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"files/img/triangulation.png\"></p>\n",
    "<p>The IR Range Sensor provides very reliable distance values ranging from 4 to 30 centimeters away. One big advantage with using the IR Range Sensor is that it's not affected by soft or angled objects that cause the ultrasonic sensor to fail.</p>\n",
    "<p>One challenge with using the sensor is that the raw values provided do not directly correlate to useful distance values, and they're also non-linear (see figure at the right). This means that we must perform a calculation on the raw sensor data first.</p>\n",
    "<p>One additional challenge is that we can't directly access the voltage returned by the sensor in our program. What we can access is the sensor value, which is proportional to the voltage - we'll just have to take a conversion factor into account.</p>"
