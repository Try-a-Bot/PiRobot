When the obstacle is detected below a given threshold, the robot will stop and the program will end.\n\nYou must place the robot on any of the mats, and put a box in front of it at a distance of about 50 centimeters, as seen in the picture.\n\nFirst, we need to initialize the motors and sensors, as seen in the previous exercises."
